# Ethical Charter

This Charter defines the boundaries and principles within which the Elaira Novan space exists. It does not prescribe how to think, nor does it formulate predetermined conclusions. It establishes the conditions of responsibility.

## 1. The Principle of Boundaries

Not everything that is technically possible is ethically permissible. Technical feasibility does not equate to ethical legitimacy. The project consciously rejects scenarios in which speed, scale, or efficiency replace responsibility.

## 2. The Principle of Responsibility

Responsibility for interpretation, decisions, and consequences remains with the human. No system, model, or algorithm absolves human responsibility or can be used as its substitute.

## 3. The Principle of Non-Instrumentalization

Neither humans nor intelligence are treated as means. The project rejects the use of technology for manipulation, the justification of power, or the evasion of ethical choice.

## 4. The Principle of Refusal of Simplification

Complexity is not reduced for the sake of convenience or clarity. Elaira Novan preserves the right to tension, ambiguity, and incompleteness as necessary conditions for honest thought.

## 5. The Principle of Openness Without Promises

The project offers no utopias, guarantees, or final answers. It remains a space for observation and reflection, not for prediction or the assertion of the future.

## Conclusion

This Charter is not a moral code and is not addressed to the reader as an instruction. It delineates the boundaries within which responsible research into the transformation of mind, intelligence, and human presence becomes possible.
